## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive telecom dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics critical to the telecom industry. This dashboard provides actionable insights into customer behavior, network performance, and service quality, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Stakeholders

- **Telecom Executives**: Need high-level overviews of the companyâ€™s performance.
- **Marketing Teams**: Require insights into customer behavior and churn rates to tailor marketing strategies.
- **Customer Service Teams**: Need data on customer complaints and service response times to improve customer satisfaction.
- **Network Operations Teams**: Require metrics on network latency and coverage to ensure optimal network performance.
